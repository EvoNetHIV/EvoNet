Transmission probabilities are calcluated as a function of risk factors (susceptible's age, type of sex, viral load of infected agent, condom usage, etc.)

The default for the core transmission paramaters are listed below. (See )
   trans_RR_uses_condoms= 0.22      
    trans_RR_LogV        = 2.89      
    trans_VLbase         = 4.0            
    trans_RR_circumcised = 0.53      
    trans_RR_age         = 0.67          
    max_age_RR_age       = 45    
    trans_base_age       = 35       
    trans_RR_insertive_anal_msm = 2.9  
    trans_RR_ins_ai      = 2.9
    trans_RR_rec_ai      = 17.3
    trans_RR_acute_phase = 1.0       
    trans_RR_receptive_vaginal=1
    trans_RR_vaccine     = 0.01      

Below are figures of transmission probabilities for MSM and heterosexual sex as a function of infector's viral load.
