Network estimation terms (1) | **modes** | **Modes** | **1** |  | **From EpiModel**
Network estimation terms (1) | nw_form_terms | terms to include in the relational formation model. Must be in the form of a right-hand formula in quotes. | "~edges" |  | N/A
Network estimation terms (1) | nw_coef_form  | values of the coefficients associated with any offset terms in the relational formation model | NULL |  | N/A
Network estimation terms (1) | target_stats | value of the statistics associated with any terms in the relational formation model (other than offset terms) | **initial_pop$*0.7/2$** |  | **MARDHAM?**

Viral load trajectory (in absence of treatment) | V0 | viral load on first day of infection | 1.E-04 | copies/ml | Set to be functionally equivalent to 0; note that this corresponds to 1 virion in the entire body, assuming 10 liters of blood and lymph
Viral load trajectory (in absence of treatment) | t_acute | time in acute infection | 90 | days | range of data sources suggesting numbers on this order; 90 is commonly used in models (Fiebig 2003, McMichael 2010)
Viral load trajectory (in absence of treatment) | t_peak | time to peak VL during acute Infection | 21.0 | days | Lindback et al. (2000)
Viral load trajectory (in absence of treatment) | t_acute_phase2 | time until the beginning of acute decline phase 2 | 55 | days | estimates vary widely in the literature; this number is approximated from data presented in Lindback et al. (2000) and Stafford et al. (2000)
Viral load trajectory (in absence of treatment) | acute_decline_phase2_rate | slope (on ln scale) during acute decline phase 2 | -0.03 | per day | Lindback et al. (2000)
Viral load trajectory (in absence of treatment) | VL_Function | **shape of the viral load function** | **"Existing"** |  | **Other option is "ModifiedLogistic"**
Viral load trajectory (in absence of treatment) | vl_increase_AIDS | daily slope in VL increase after AIDS onset (CD4 <200) | 1.0041122 | per day | Correpsonds to a 400-fold increase over 4 years, i.e. 1.0041122^(4*365) = 400. This is drawn from common schematics of HIV progression; e.g. Oâ€™Brien and Hendrickson 2013, Fauci et al. 1996
Viral load trajectory (in presence of treatment) | vl_exp_decline_tx | rate of exponential decline in viral load with treatment | -0.6 | per day | Ho 1995, Wei 1995, Perelson 1996, Perelson 1997. **(Largely reflects the first-phase decay rate for PI-containing regimens)**
Viral load trajectory (in presence of treatment) | vl_full_supp | viral load when fully suppressed | 13 | copies/ml | Palmer et al 2003
Viral load trajectory (in presence of treatment) | vl_undetectable | VL Undetectable Level | 50 | copies/ml | standard 
Transmission flag | transmission_model  | Transmission Model | "hughes" |  | N/A. Other options are "hill" and "exponential"
Transmission parameters **(when transmission_model = "hughes" or "hill" or "exponential")** | | **WHAT ABOUT AN INTERCEPT?** |  |  |  |
Transmission parameters **(when transmission_model = "hughes" or "hill" or "exponential")** | trans_RR_uses_condoms | rel. risk of transmission if condoms are used | 0.22 |  | Hughes et al. 2012

Transmission parameters **(when transmission_model = "hughes" or "hill" or "exponential")** | trans_RR_circumcised | rel. risk of transmission to male engaging in insertive penile-vaginal or insertive penile-anal sex if circumsized  | 0.53 |  | Hughes et al. 2012
Transmission parameters **(when transmission_model = "hughes" or "hill" or "exponential")** | trans_RR_age | rel. risk of transmission per 10-year increase in age of **(transmitting partner? negative partner?)** | 0.67 | 10-year difference | Hughes et al. 2012
Transmission parameters **(when transmission_model = "hughes" or "hill" or "exponential")** | trans_base_age | base age for calcuating relative risk of transmission | 35 | years | Hughes et al. 2012
