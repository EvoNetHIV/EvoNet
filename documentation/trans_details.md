Transmission details
================

Transmission probabilities are calcluated as a function of risk factors (susceptible's age, type of sex, viral load of infected agent, condom usage, etc.)

The default for the core transmission paramaters are listed below. (See [Model details](https://evonethiv.github.io/EvoNetHIV/documentation/Model_details.html) for formal calculations)   
trans\_RR\_uses\_condoms= 0.22    
trans\_RR\_LogV = 2.89  
trans\_VLbase = 4.0  
trans\_RR\_circumcised = 0.53  
trans\_RR\_age = 0.67  
max\_age\_RR\_age = 45  
trans\_base\_age = 35  
trans\_RR\_insertive\_anal\_msm = 2.9  
trans\_RR\_ins\_ai = 2.9  
trans\_RR\_rec\_ai = 17.3  
trans\_RR\_acute\_phase = 1.0  
trans\_RR\_receptive\_vaginal=1   
trans\_RR\_vaccine = 0.01  

Below are example of transmission probabilities for MSM and heterosexual sex as a function of infector's viral load, STI status, MSM role, and condom use.
