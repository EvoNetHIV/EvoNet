Transmission details
================

Transmission probabilities are calcluated as a function of risk factors (susceptible's age, type of sex, viral load of infected agent, condom usage, etc.)

The default for the core transmission paramaters are listed below. (See ) trans\_RR\_uses\_condoms= 0.22
trans\_RR\_LogV = 2.89
trans\_VLbase = 4.0
trans\_RR\_circumcised = 0.53
trans\_RR\_age = 0.67
max\_age\_RR\_age = 45
trans\_base\_age = 35
trans\_RR\_insertive\_anal\_msm = 2.9
trans\_RR\_ins\_ai = 2.9 trans\_RR\_rec\_ai = 17.3 trans\_RR\_acute\_phase = 1.0
trans\_RR\_receptive\_vaginal=1 trans\_RR\_vaccine = 0.01

Below are figures of transmission probabilities for MSM and heterosexual sex as a function of infector's viral load.
